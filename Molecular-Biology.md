## Mutations
Mutations refers to any alteration in DNA sequence of an organism. Mutation could be synonymous the change is in the DNA sequence that codes for amino acids in a protein sequence, but does not change the encoded amino acid or non synymous whereby it alters the amino acid sequence of a protein. 
### Somatic mutations
Occur in a single body cell and cannot be inherited (only tissues derived from mutated cell are affected) 
### Germline mutations 
Occur in gametes and can be passed onto offspring (every cell in the entire organism will be affected)
