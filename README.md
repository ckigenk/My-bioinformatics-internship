# About me
Hello. My name is Collins Kigen, and am currently a researcher working on Negeleted Tropical Diseases. My background is in Biochemistry and for the past two years I have engaged on research in African Trypanosomiasis with the main aim of understanding its mechanism of transmission as well as development of effective and sustainable control strategies. I am interested in the application of multi-omics in research, and therefore am undertaking this bioinformatics internship in order to gain knowldege and skills in bioinformatics to complement my broad experience in molecular biology. 
# Vision
To become a world-class scientist and leader in the multi-omic research
# Mission
To utilize modern technologies in molecular biology, biotechnology, and bioinformatics to make discoveries that are impactful and applicable in alleviating the disease burden in Africa
# Roadmap
[Here](https://github.com/ckigenk/My-bioinformatics-internship/issues/1) is my roadmap for this this internship program
